"""Integration tests covering the full workflow lifecycle against the Agamemnon stub.

Drives a real httpx.AsyncClient through tests/stub_agamemnon.py so HTTP
serialisation, retry logic, status polling, dependency unblock, and teardown
are exercised end-to-end. Hook-callback firing is intentionally NOT tested
here — that is an internal observer concern unit-tested in
tests/test_executor.py (TestHooks).
